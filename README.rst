PICAchooser
===========

A simple gui tool for scanning through MELODIC ICA runs and quickly making decisions about which components to retain.  This tool does one thing, but it does it quickly and easily using only keyboard input.

Basically, PICAchooser loads the results of a MELODIC ICA run and lets you step through the components, look at them, and decide if you want to keep them or discard them.  After you load the dataset, you get a window showing the active IC component (both the timecourse and the spatial map), the power spectrum of the active IC component, and the motion timecourses for comparison.  By default, components are flagged to be kept (and the timecourses are in green).


Usage
=====

.. code:: bash
usage: PICAchooser FEATDIR [options]

A program to review (and alter) melodic component selections.

positional arguments:
  featdir               The FEAT directory associated with this MELODIC run.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --melodicdir MELODICDIR
                        The location of the MELODIC directory to classified.
  --aromadir AROMADIR   The location of the AROMA directory.
  --fixmelodicdir FIXMELODICDIR
                        The location of the MELODIC directory to be used for FIX.
  --outputfile OUTPUTFILE
                        The name of the new component file (if not specified, it will be put in the appropriate directory with a standard name).
  --displaythresh DISPLAYTHRESH
                        z threshold for the displayed ICA components. Default is 2.3.




Controls
========

To toggle whether the current component should be kept or discarded, press the up or down arrow key.  You can change back and forth as much as you want.

To go to the next (or previous) component, press the right (or left) arrow.  You'll wrap around if you hit the end.

Press the escape key at any time to save the current version of the component list.  The component list is saved automatically when you quit.


Options
=======
If you invoke PICAchooser with the --melodicdir MELODICDIR option, it just treats it as an ordinary melodic analysis for you to hand tag.  By default, it will write out a file called

If you invoke PICAchooser with the --fixmelodicdir option, it makes a hand labelling file in the appropriate format with the appropriate name, if youâ€™re making a training set.

And if you invoke with the --aromadir option, it displays what components AROMA flagged and lets you change the selections.
